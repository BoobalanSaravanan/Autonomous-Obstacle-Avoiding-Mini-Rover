# Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoiding-Mini-Rover
The Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Mini Rover is a self-navigating robot that uses an ultrasonic sensor on a servo motor to detect obstacles and avoid collisions. Controlled by an Arduino Uno and powered by DC motors through an L298N driver, it intelligently scans and chooses a clear path, enabling smooth, autonomous movement.
